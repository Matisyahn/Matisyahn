  <summary>üë®‚Äçüíª More about me</summary>
  
  - üí¨ My name is Matheus, I‚Äôm from Brazil, and I‚Äôm 24 years old. I have an intermediate level of English and am constantly striving to reach an advanced level. I have experience with tools like Figma and Illustrator, where I learned at SAGA, a pioneer in game development education. Currently, I work as a UX/UI Designer and Graphic Designer at a smart solutions company called Nocobi, where we focus on developing applications and reports using Microsoft Power Platform. I have been on this journey for a little over a year, and it has been fantastic. I value interpersonal relationships for generating new ideas and knowledge that can help elevate our work to a new level.

  - ‚ö° I enjoy spending my free time reading books, comics, and manga. I also love playing guitar, listening to music, and watching series.

A few of my favorites...
